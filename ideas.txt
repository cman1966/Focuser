Project box must support:
- LED		Drill hole in top of box
- USB		Drill hole in end of box; alternatively, leave USB plugged in all the time...
- Access to enabling/disabling capacitor	from top?
- wires for motor (6-wire, phone cable?)
- Wires for temperature (3-wire)

Connector ideas:
----------------
DB9					- easy, supports motor and temperature; inflexible cable
Phone (6p6c, rj11)	- small, motor only


Strain relief


todo:
----
- hole for usb in main box
- hole for LED in lid, solder LED
- plug for capacitor, solder capacitor

- decide on motor box
- cut hole for db9 on motor box
- solder db9 to motor board and temperature sensor

-- temperature sensor on motor box or main box?
-- use 9v for VIN? if so, power for unl9003 sb from 9v, not 5v from board
